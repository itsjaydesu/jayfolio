      <p>
        Each entry here can expand into imagery, credits, and the interactive story behind the work. For now we stage a
        trio of placeholders outlining the tone, collaborators, and medium.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Project Alpha — immersive WebGL wavefield powering a launch event, adaptive to live tempo shifts.</li>
        <li>Signal Bloom — modular installation linking light pillars to sensor-driven melodic gestures.</li>
        <li>Resonant Atlas — browser-based instrument that orchestrates field recordings with gestural input.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Replace these with the flagship case studies you want to surface. If you need richer formatting, nest cards or
        timelines inside this panel.
