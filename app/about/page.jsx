        Placeholder bio copy lives here. Imagine a concise narrative about guiding clients through ambient interfaces,
        spatial audio sketches, and tactile exhibition builds. Layer in origin notes, ethos, and the shorthand that gives
        collaborators an instant sense of cadence.

          Summarize the studio posture: designing cinematic UI, prototyping with sensors, and orchestrating field-driven
          performance systems. Mention current collaborators you want to spotlight once real content is ready.
