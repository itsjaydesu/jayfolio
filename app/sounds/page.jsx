      <h2>Sound Experiments</h2>
      <p>
        This panel will eventually host streaming embeds, liner notes, or patch diagrams for each sonic experiment. For
        now we outline the vibe so you can drop in assets later.

      <ul>
        <li>Chromatic Drones — looping textures tuned for night sessions and focus rituals.</li>
        <li>Pulse Sketches — percussive prototypes enabling live manipulation during performances.</li>
        <li>Archive Reworks — archival stems reshaped into ambient suites for immersive rooms.</li>

        <h3>Release Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Plan for platform drops, licensing notes, or merch pairings. When the files are ready, embed players or
          scheduling widgets so visitors can listen without leaving the field.
