      <h2>Immersive Field Hub</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the latest build of the Hypnotic Field interface. Use the retro control at center stage to activate
        project dossiers, origin stories, written artefacts, sound experiments, and art studies. Each channel opens a
        focused panel with richer detail while the ripple field responds to your navigation.

        <h3>Navigation Map</h3>
        <p>
          The menu mirrors a workstation switcher: About introduces the operator, Projects highlights installations,
          Content curates essays and writings, Sounds archives auditory experiments, and Art documents the dot field gallery. Cycle
          through them to see the background waves remix in real-time.

        <h3>Control Console</h3>
        <p>
          The floating GUI exposes amplitude, glow, rotation, and ripple behaviour. Randomize to explore alternate moods
          or export the current configuration to revisit later. Everything you see is placeholder copy for nowâ€”swap it
          with true content once the structure feels right.
