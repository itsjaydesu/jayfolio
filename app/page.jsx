      <p>
        Welcome to the latest build of the Hypnotic Field interface. Use the retro control at center stage to
        activate project dossiers, origin stories, written artefacts, and sound experiments. Each channel opens a
        focused panel with richer detail while the ripple field responds to your navigation.
      </p>
      <hr className="panel-divider" />
      <p>
        The controls floating opposite let you tune amplitude, glow, rotation, and ripple behaviour. Randomize to
        explore alternate moods, or export the current configuration to revisit later. Everything you see is placeholder
        copy for nowâ€”swap it with true content once the structure feels right.
